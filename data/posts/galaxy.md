## What

A simulation of galaxy using Three.js particles. It turns out particle rendering is very performant despite a large number of them are used. 

## Tunable parameters
Many of the parameters can be adjusted and further remixed, such as:

- number of branches
- number of particles
- inside and outside color of the spiral
